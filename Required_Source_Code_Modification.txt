Keyboard issue
--------------
Keyboard not working was because there was changes inside the drivers/input/evdev.c source. The following line inside 3.0.1 must be changed (the changes are shown below)

- line 114 must be changed from

		if (type == EV_SYN && code == SYN_REPORT)
			wake_up_interruptible(&evdev->wait);
  to
		wake_up_interruptible(&evdev->wait);					
		
- line 394-395 must be changed from

	if (client->packet_head == client->tail && evdev->exist &&
	    (file->f_flags & O_NONBLOCK))	    

  to 	    		

	if (client->head == client->tail && evdev->exist &&
	    (file->f_flags & O_NONBLOCK))
	    
- line 398-399 must be changed from

	retval = wait_event_interruptible(evdev->wait,client->packet_head != client->tail || !evdev->exist);	    
		
  to
  
  	retval = wait_event_interruptible(evdev->wait,client->head != client->tail || !evdev->exist);
  	
  	
- line 428 must be changed from 

 	if (client->packet_head != client->tail)
	
   to

     if (client->head != client->tail)
